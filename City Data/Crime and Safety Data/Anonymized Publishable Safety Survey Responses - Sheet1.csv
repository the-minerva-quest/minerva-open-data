I saw the front desk robbed, stepped out of the building & into a police crime scene or actively unfolding situation (on multiple occasions), was followed to the door (on mutliple occasions), regularly saw drug deals from windows on any side of the building, & was grabbed on the corner of Turk street & Market. To name a few of the instances.",Yes,1,San Francisco: 16 Turk Street,1,2,"Three instances from Turk street & all last semester
1) I was grabbed on the corner of Mason, Turk Street, & Market Street (not the corner by Diya but across the way towards Abe's pizza) by someone regularly spending time on this corner. The incident occurred during the afternoon. I was in a group of four (including one male) & there were a number of other people nearby on the street. I saw the guy size me up as I crossed the street & was prepared to defend myself when he reached for me. I knew that I needed to come off as ""not an easy target"" immediately or possibly face continued or even escalating issues over the course of the semester. I did not report to the police but have continued to feel uneasiness whenever passing this corner, espeically because I have regularly seen this person again. Retroactively, I wonder how much worse & more dangerous my semester could have been if I hadn't been paying attention & was --even for a moment-- successfully surprised or grabbed that day.
2) I was threatened at knife point to my temple in the Financial District's embarcadero centers (granted this happened further from the residence but the feeling of being unsafe from this incicent farther from the res was perpetuated by the dynamics close to the res). I was asked for a lighter, which I did not have. I talked the individual into calming down & they continued on their way. I did not file a polic report. This ocurred in the afternoon when I was alone. Again, I consider myself incredibly fortunate & know the situation could have gone much worse.
3) I was followed to the door of the Turk street residence by the same man on multiple occasions. He managed to follow me despite all of my efforts to lose him in different turns, stopping at stores, and taking alternative routes to the building (while still being constrained by the streets I felt safe walking down). If this had ocurred a third time (or if it ocurrs again this semester) I am inclined to file a report of some sort out of concerns of being stalked or otherwise targetted for an unknown reason.

One instance from 1412 in spring of 2019
I was studying at Peet's coffee (the one on the corner of Mission closest to the 1412 residence). Another patron initially began a semi-friendly, semi-weird conversation but after his subtle attempts being rejected, he began to verbally assult me. I had suspicians that this man had been stalking me but did not have evidence to prove such (having seen him at 3 different cafes or places in the city that week & him trying to have this same conversation with me repeatedly). He began threatening me & yelling derogatory slurs at me (including calling me a genetic mutation & responsible for all the mistakes of my caucasian ancesters, asking how I could live with myself & why I hadn't killed myself). He did not leave me alone after my repeated polite attempts to ask him to do so. Other patrons started to yell at him. The situation escalated. The man made some attempts to physically come towards me. The police were called. The man was escorted out of the building by the employees and a number of other patrons. 

None of these incidences were ever reported to Minerva building staff because I did not see what use they could be & found such to be a waste of time & effort & emotional expenditure on my part.
